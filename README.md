# BukkitTTY
BukkitTTY is just a very very basic bukkit plugin that basically just allows you to execute shell commands under any unix execution environment that has access to the ```bash``` command.
##How to use ?
This project uses Maven so you'll need it to build BukkitTTY. Once built, copy the jar into your server's plugins/ folder. The command to launch any command is ```/shell <command> [--shellDir$0]``` where $0 would be the directory where the command should be launched, by default the server's working directory (**Attention !** There is no space between the *--shelDir* and whatever you put instead of *$0*)
##What about the license
BukkitTTY is under GPL but hey, there's really not much in it !
##What's next ?
Well, I may make it better, but for now I have no need to do such thing so that's it !
